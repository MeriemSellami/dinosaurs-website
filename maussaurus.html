            <h3>About Mosasaurs</h3>
            <p>Mosasaurs was a genus of large aquatic reptiles that lived during the Late Cretaceous period, around 70-66 million years ago. Mosasauruses were powerful marine predators, resembling a mix between a crocodile and a monitor lizard, with streamlined bodies, strong jaws, and paddle-like limbs. They were not dinosaurs but belonged to a group of marine reptiles known as squamates, which also includes snakes and lizards. Mosasauruses were apex predators in the oceans of their time, preying on a variety of marine creatures. Fossil evidence suggests they had a global distribution and adapted to various marine environments.</p>
            <p>Mosasaurus was a carnivore. It lived in the Cretaceous period and inhabited Europe and North America. Its fossils have been found in places such as Centre-Loire Valley (France), South Dakota and Nebraska.</p>
            <p>Artistic depictions of the Mosasaur vary immensely, mainly because it is perhaps the most frequently depicted of all marine reptiles.</p>
